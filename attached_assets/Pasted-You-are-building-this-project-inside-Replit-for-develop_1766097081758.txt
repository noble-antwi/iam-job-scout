You are building this project inside Replit for development, but the final deployment must NOT be on Replit. You must provide the best external hosting options and guide me step-by-step on how to deploy.

App: “IAM Job Scout” (US, junior–mid roles)

Build a web app that finds US job postings focused on Identity & Access Management (IAM) and sends a scheduled email digest. It must exclude senior/advanced roles and focus only on junior to medium roles.

1) Tech Stack

Backend: Python + FastAPI

Frontend: Jinja2 templates (preferred simplest) OR minimal React (only if needed)

DB: SQLite + SQLAlchemy (V1)

Scheduler: APScheduler (daily scan + daily/weekly digest)

Email: SendGrid (primary) + SMTP fallback

Packaging: Docker support required (Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml)

2) Data Source (No risky scraping)

Use Google Programmable Search Engine (CSE) JSON API to search for postings and store only:

title, snippet, URL, detected company/location if possible
Do NOT scrape full job boards.

Env vars:

GOOGLE_CSE_API_KEY

GOOGLE_CSE_CX

SENDGRID_API_KEY

FROM_EMAIL

TO_EMAIL

ADMIN_PASSWORD

Include .env.example.

3) Junior–Mid Filtering (Critical)

Exclude if contains:

senior, sr, principal, architect, lead, manager, director, head, vp, staff, distinguished, chief

Prefer include:

analyst, associate, administrator, engineer, specialist, iam, identity, okta, entra, azure ad, sso, saml, oidc, scim, iga, pam, sailpoint, saviynt, ping, cyberark

Experience filter:

include 0-5 years, 1-3, 2-4, 3-5

exclude 7+, 10+, 12+

Add scoring and dedupe.

4) App Features

Dashboard (latest scan, new jobs, job list, filters)

Settings (recipient email, digest frequency, keyword lists, send test email)

Admin actions (password protected): run scan now, send digest now

DB tables: Jobs, Settings, ScanRun, DigestRun

Demo mode if env vars are missing

Auth:

Simple admin password session login using ADMIN_PASSWORD

5) External Hosting Instructions (MUST be in README)

Create a README section: “Deployment (Not Replit)” with three options, and clearly mark one as recommended.

Option A (RECOMMENDED): Render + Render Cron Job

Deploy FastAPI as a Render Web Service

Use a Render Cron Job to call internal endpoints:

/admin/run-scan

/admin/send-digest

Steps must include:

push repo to GitHub

create Render web service

set build/start commands

set env vars

create cron schedule and auth token header

Option B: Fly.io (Docker)

Use Dockerfile

Steps:

fly launch

set secrets

deploy

Scheduling approach:

either a separate Fly machine/cron-like workflow OR GitHub Actions hitting endpoints

Option C: VPS (DigitalOcean / Lightsail / small Ubuntu server)

Use Docker Compose

Add Nginx + HTTPS (Caddy recommended for simplicity)

Use systemd + cron (or just cron calling endpoints locally)

Include steps for firewall + basic hardening

Also include:

HTTPS guidance

how to keep scheduler reliable (cron-triggered jobs preferred over in-process scheduler for production)

logging + monitoring basics

6) Project Structure

main.py

templates/, static/

db/, search/, jobs/, email/, scheduler/

Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml

README.md, .env.example, requirements.txt

7) Deliverables

Working app in Replit

Docker build works

README includes the external deployment steps (Render recommended)

Demo mode works without API keys

Small extra requirement (important)

Implement an API key protection for admin endpoints:

ADMIN_API_TOKEN env var

Require header: X-ADMIN-TOKEN: <token> for cron-triggered endpoints
(Separate from UI password login.)
